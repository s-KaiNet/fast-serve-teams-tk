## Minimal path to awesome

### Deploy the app

>Here are the instructions to run the sample in **Visual Studio Code**. You can also try to run the app using TeamsFx CLI tool, refer to [Try sample with TeamsFx CLI](cli.md)

1. Clone the repo to your local workspace or directly download the source code.
1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code, click `Provision` in LIFECYCLE panel of Microsoft Teams Toolkit extension or open the command palette and select `Teams: Provision`. This step will create an app in Teams App Studio.
1. Go back to Microsoft Teams Toolkit extension, click `Deploy` in LIFECYCLE panel or open the command palette and select `Teams: Deploy`.
    > This step will build a SharePoint package (*.sppkg) under `sharepoint/solution` folder. The Teams Toolkit will automatically upload and deploy it to your tenant App Catalog site. Only tenant App Catalog site admin has permission to do it. If you are not the admin, you can create your test tenant following [Setup your Microsoft 365 tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-developer-tenant).

### Launch the app in Teams

1. Once deployment is completed, you can preview the app. In Visual Studio Code, select target environment and click `Preview App` in ENVIRONMENT panel to open a browser.

### Run the app locally

1. In Debug mode, select one of the debug configurations (`SharePoint workbench`, `Teams workbench`, `Outlook workbench` and `The Microsoft 365 app workbench` are supported) and press start button. The browser will be opened and you need to sign in with your Microsoft 365 account.
2. Click `Add` if you selected `Teams workbench` in previous step.
